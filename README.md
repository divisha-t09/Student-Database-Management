# Student-Database-Management
This C++ program allows you to manage student records, including entering, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting student data. You can maintain records for multiple students with details such as name, roll number, course, semester, and contact information.

## Features:-
- Add and maintain student records, including name, roll number, course, semester, and contact information.
- Display the details of all entered student records.
- Search for a student record by roll number.
- Update the data for a specific student.
- Delete student records, either all records or a specific student's record.

## How to Use:-
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the student_record.cpp file.

2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, you can use the g++ compiler as follows:
`g++ student_record.cpp -o student_record`

3. Run the program:
`./student_record`

4. You will be presented with a menu of options to manage student records:
> **Enter 1** to enter data for one or more students.
> **Enter 2** to display the data for all entered students.
> **Enter 3** to search for a specific student's data by roll number.
> **Enter 4** to update the data for a specific student.
> **Enter 5** to delete student records, either all records or a specific student's record.
> **Enter 6** to exit the program.

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform the desired operation.

6. The program will display appropriate messages and results based on your selections.

## Note:-
This program provides a basic demonstration of student record management and does not include features like data persistence (saving records to a file) or data validation. You can enhance the program to include these features if needed. Ensure you enter data accurately to avoid issues with searching, updating, and deleting records.
